# introduction to digital history 

This repository contains the source code of a [course book](https://wissen-ist-acht.github.io/digitalhistory.intro/) that was initially developed in 2022 for teaching first year history students at the University of Basel, as part of the mandatory introductory course, and should be understood as a first entry point for them to the basics of digital history. As the introductory courses cover topics from different epochs and eras, the content will grow over time to include a variety of examples for dh projects, be them medieval, contemporary, with a focus on Eastern Europe, Africa, or Judaism. The course is complemented by a live session during the semester, but the content should also be useful without this element for those trying to get familiar with digital history. For any comments, suggestions or complaints, please get in touch, through [mail](mailto:ina.serif@unibas.ch) or by opening an issue.
